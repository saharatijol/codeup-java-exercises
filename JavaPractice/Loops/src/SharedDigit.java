public class SharedDigit {

    /*
    * Write a method named hasSharedDigit with two parameters of type int
    * Each number should be within range of 10(inclusive) - 99(inclusive).
    * If one of the numbers is not within range, the method should return false
    * The method should return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as 2 in 12 and 23; otherwise, the method should return false
    *
    * Example I/O:
    * hasSharedDigit(12, 23); -> true
    * hasSharedDigit(9, 99); -> false, since 9 is not within range of 10-99
    * hasSharedDigit(15, 55); -> true
    *
